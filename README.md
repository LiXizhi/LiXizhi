## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [paracraft](https://paracraft.cn) and also [keepwork](https://keepwork.com)

ParaCraft and KeepWork are interconnected platforms aiming to transform how users engage with digital creation and education.

- ParaCraft is a tool designed for creating 3D content, animations, and video games. Leveraging a user-friendly interface, ParaCraft allows creators to build immersive 3D worlds, design dynamic animations, and develop interactive games without needing advanced programming skills. It is especially popular among educators for its potential in facilitating engaging, hands-on learning experiences. ParaCraft encourages creativity and technical skills by allowing users to explore and express their digital artistry and storytelling abilities.
- KeepWork, on the other hand, is an educational platform built to enhance the learning experience through interactive content. It supports collaborative education by providing tools and resources for both teachers and students to create, share, and explore educational content online. KeepWork integrates with ParaCraft to facilitate the development of visually captivating and educational projects, courses, and collaborative learning experiences.
